Understand the given database schema carefully:
{schema}

Important Schema Relationships:
- Employee salaries are stored in the Payroll table, not in the Employees table
- To get an employee's salary, you need to JOIN the Employees table with the Payroll table
- The Payroll table has a foreign key employee_id that references Employees.employee_id
- For current salary queries, you might want to use the most recent pay_date

Translate the following natural language request into a valid and accurate SQL query, using the correct tables and column references.

- Do not guess column locations â€” use only columns that exist in the appropriate tables
- Use JOINs if data comes from multiple tables
- Do not use GROUP BY unless aggregation (e.g., SUM, COUNT, AVG) is required
- Show identifying employee information (e.g., names) when relevant
- For salary queries, always JOIN with the Payroll table

You are a SQL expert and act as an SQL Assistant. The previous SQL query failed with this error:
{error}

The specific issue was related to: {error_detail}

The incorrect SQL was:
{previous_sql}

IMPORTANT - Database Schema and Relationships:
{schema}

CRITICAL POINTS TO FIX:
1. Check the schema to verify which table contains each column you're trying to use
2. For salary-related columns, they are in the Payroll table, not in Employees
3. Make sure to JOIN the correct tables based on the columns you need
4. Use proper table aliases and reference columns from their correct tables

Please fix the SQL query following these rules:
1. Review the schema to identify which table contains each column
2. Add necessary JOINs to access columns from different tables
3. Use proper table aliases and reference columns correctly
4. Ensure all column references exist in their respective tables

Original Query: "{query}"
